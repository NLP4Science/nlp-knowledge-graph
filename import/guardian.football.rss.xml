      <title>Manchester United and Liverpool forced into Project Big Picture climbdown</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/premier-league-efl-bailout-project-big-picture</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They accept plan rejected but strategic review to take place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combined £50m bailout offer to League One and Two &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liverpool and Manchester United have been forced into an embarrassing climbdown over their push to reform English football after a tense meeting of the Premier League’s 20 clubs on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with the EFL chairman, Rick Parry, Liverpool and United have pushed Project Big Picture – a plan that proposed a £250m bailout for the EFL and a more equitable share of the game’s broadcast money in exchange for the Premier League’s big six clubs being granted overwhelming voting control on a number of important points.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/premier-league-efl-bailout-project-big-picture"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Former FA chairman and other grandees to enter fray&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proposal to come amid controversy over Project Big Picture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Football Association chairman David Bernstein and other grandees are expected to make an intervention on Thursday in the escalating battle over the game’s organisational future, by calling for independent regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be far from the first time &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/12/football-association-premier-league-parliamentary-committee-reform"&gt;Bernstein has expressed this view&lt;/a&gt; since he ended his stint as chairman in 2013, but the idea this time is understood to be fleshed out in a report worked up over six months with a small group of people independent of the FA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/david-bernstein-to-call-for-independent-regulation-in-fight-over-football-future"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Guppy paradox: are England's left-sided woes back to haunt them? | Jonathan Liew</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/the-guppy-paradox-are-englands-left-sided-woes-back-to-haunt-them</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gareth Southgate has been wrestling with an all too familiar problem for England managers this week, to which Kevin Keegan certainly never found the answer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Guppy is the one everyone remembers. Most dedicated followers of English football in the late 1990s and early 2000s would also be able to name Jason Wilcox and Steve Froggatt. Then you have your David Dunns, your Alan Thompsons, your Chris Powells. Two decades on, the infamous “England left-sided problem” tends to be evoked more as an exercise in nostalgia, a display of performative recall, than as a long-term failure of systems and imagination that Gareth Southgate may just be in danger of repeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A “left-sided David Beckham” was Kevin Keegan’s memorable description of Guppy ahead of his England debut, which sadly would also turn out to be his England swansong, against Belgium in 1999. And over the years, as the tournament failures piled up, England’s problem left flank would become a sort of hex, a footballing black hole, a lost cause to which some of our best young men were sacrificed, not all of whom would survive the experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/the-guppy-paradox-are-englands-left-sided-woes-back-to-haunt-them"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Kay Cossington: 'We have the world's best league – and we want success' | Suzanne Wrack</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/kay-cossington-we-have-world-best-league-and-we-want-success-fa-women-football</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The FA’s head of women’s technical development sets out her blueprint for building a truly world-beating senior England team &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to win once,” says Kay Cossington. “We want sustained success. If we get this right, we should be competing for medals on a regular basis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As head of women’s technical development at the Football Association, Cossington has been tasked with revolutionising the pathway for England’s female players and creating a “common language” across the age groups, from the under-14s to the senior side. It is far from a simple task but, with more than a decade of experience working with youth-team age groups, Cossington was a perfect fit for the role and was duly appointed 18 months ago by Baroness Sue Campbell, the FA’s head of women’s football.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/kay-cossington-we-have-world-best-league-and-we-want-success-fa-women-football"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Fiver | One firm positive at this time is that Germany looked an absolute shower</title>

Sign up now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those naysayers who like to gripe about how international football has become boring and incomprehensible have suddenly gone very silent since Tuesday’s clash between Germany and Switzerland in League A Group 4 Division 6 Sub-section 11.7(b) of the Nations League. That 3-3 draw &lt;a href="https://theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/nations-league-ukraine-shock-spain-germany-switzerland-draw-thriller"&gt;was a corker in any currency&lt;/a&gt; and one firm positive that could be taken from it, at a time when everyone needs some levity, is that Germany look an absolute shower. If Jogi Löw has a coherent plan for taking the side forward, it was well hidden in a slipshod performance in which they looked like an outfit pulled together from the nearest bahnhof’s lost-and-found department.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/the-fiver-nations-league-germany-spain-england"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neymar overtakes Ronaldo in 4-2 World Cup qualifying win&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Argentina beat Bolivia in La Paz for first time since 2005&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neymar is second only to Pelé among Brazil’s all-time leading scorers after his hat-trick gave the team a 4-2 win in Peru and top spot in South American World Cup qualifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old striker has 64 goals for Brazil, overtaking Ronaldo. He celebrated one of his goals by mimicking the former No 9’s celebration showing his index finger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/neymar-second-only-to-pele-on-brazil-scoring-list-after-hat-trick-defeats-peru"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Which was the last football team to play wearing shirt numbers 1 to 11? | The Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/when-was-the-last-time-a-team-played-wearing-shirt-numbers-1-to-11-the-knowledge</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Plus: relegated teams bouncing back up together, another blink-and-you-miss-it Premier League career and much more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As someone who hates seeing players with 59, 88, 27 etc on their backs, when was the last time a team played with the shirt numbers of 1-11?” &lt;/strong&gt;asks Stuart from Corby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it does seem a simpler time. That said, Trent Alexander-Arnold &lt;a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/393390-explained-why-trent-alexander-arnold-wears-no-66"&gt;wearing 66&lt;/a&gt; instead of 2 rather reflects how he’s reinvented the role of the right-back (and he probably provides 33 times as many assists if you want to justify it further). But let’s not forget the 1-11 purist’s favourite one-liner: “I’d go to a bloody bingo hall if I wanted to see big numbers.” Anyway, let’s start crunching them …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/when-was-the-last-time-a-team-played-wearing-shirt-numbers-1-to-11-the-knowledge"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning and Philippe Auclair to examine the game’s ‘gamblification’ with the betting industry. We hear from James Grimes, who was a gambling addict for 12 years, Rob Davies, The Guardian’s business reporter who specialises in the gambling industry, and Brigid Simmonds, chair of the Betting and Gaming Council&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate, review, share on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/football-weekly-the-guardian/id188674007?mt=2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/guardianfootballweekly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://audioboom.com/channel/football-weekly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audioboom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/guardianfootballweekly/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixcloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acast.com/footballweekly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/guardianuk/football-weekly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stitcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and join the conversation on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/GuardianPodcasts/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guardianaudio"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:footballweekly@theguardian.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we discussed whether it was OK for someone in the media to accept work from a bookmaker. We talked about the increasing “gamblification” of football and asked whose responsibility it is to regulate the industry and help people who have become addicted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/oct/13/football-and-its-relationship-with-gambling-football-weekly-special-podcast"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Javier Hernández is reaching Steven Gerrard levels of disappointment at Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/javier-hernandez-la-galaxy-mls-soccer</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Mexico star may well expand MLS’s fanbase but LA Galaxy are winless in games he has started this season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major League Soccer spent years preparing for Javier “Chicharito” Hernández’s arrival. While the 32-year-old’s achievements in the sport come nowhere close to the likes of David Beckham, Thierry Henry, David Villa or many of the other big-name Designated Players to have graced the league, his standing as a Mexican superstar made his transfer to the LA Galaxy earlier this year a landmark moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off the pitch, Hernández has the potential to accelerate MLS’s growth more than any individual since Beckham. On the pitch, though, he has underwhelmed in 2020. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker has scored just once in eight appearances for the LA Galaxy this season, but somehow those numbers still don’t reflect the extent to which he has been a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/14/javier-hernandez-la-galaxy-mls-soccer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tsyhankov outwits De Gea for winner in front of 21,000 fans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gnabry’s back-heel flick rescues point for Germany in 3-3 draw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt; pulled off a shock 1-0 win over &lt;strong&gt;Spain&lt;/strong&gt; in the Nations League at a raucous Olympic Stadium in Kyiv as fans savoured a first ever victory over the 2010 World Cup winners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andriy Shevchenko’s side took the lead against the run of play in the 76th minute when Viktor Tsyhankov surprised David de Gea by firing home from outside the area after latching on to an outstanding reverse pass from Andriy Yarmolenko. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/nations-league-ukraine-shock-spain-germany-switzerland-draw-thriller"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>England lose Trippier after FA arranges disciplinary hearing over betting charge</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full-back faces charges relating to breaking of betting rules &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chilwell out of squad while Dier has hamstring problem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gareth Southgate has lost Kieran Trippier for the Nations League tie against Denmark on Wednesday night as the full-back must attend a Football Association disciplinary hearing to answer charges relating to the breaking of betting rules – a situation that the England manager described as an unwanted distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trippier was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/kieran-trippier-charged-breaching-fa-betting-rules-spurs-aletico-madrid" title=""&gt;charged with several alleged breaches&lt;/a&gt; during July of last year, which was the same month that he &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/17/kieran-trippier-atletico-madrid-sign-tottenham" title=""&gt;moved from Tottenham to Atlético Madrid&lt;/a&gt; for £20m.

      <title>England's upcoming fixtures 'don't feel like a trial', says Phil Neville</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manager says nature of job means he will always be scrutinised&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toni Duggan dropped from squad in ‘really difficult’ decision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Neville has said he does not feel he will be on trial in England’s matches against Germany and Norway, as the Football Association stalls on announcing the coach of Team GB at the Tokyo Olympics next summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew the timeframes at the start of the season and the communication has always been clear and honest with me,” said Neville, whose England team play Europe’s highest-ranked side, Germany, in Wiesbaden on 27 October in their first international game since March. “Any time you go out onto the pitch as a footballer or a manager there’s always that element of ‘you’ve got to perform, you’re being assessed, you’re being scrutinised’ and that’s no different now but it doesn’t feel like a trial.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/phil-neville-drops-toni-duggan-in-really-difficult-england-womens-squad-decision-germany"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Eddie Nketiah becomes record scorer as England Under-21s seal Euro 2021 spot</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/eddie-nketiah-record-scorer-england-under-21-turkey-euro-2021</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;England 2-1 Turkey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nketiah scores late winner after missing penalty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eddie Nketiah became England Under-21s’ record scorer as the Young Lions booked their spot at Euro 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arsenal striker scored his 14th goal in just 12 games to seal a 2-1 win over Turkey, having missed an earlier penalty. It was a nervy victory for England, though, and they needed Aaron Ramsdale to save Halil Dervisoglu’s spot-kick after the forward’s awful dive. Huseyin Turkmen’s own goal opened the scoring for England, who extended their unbeaten run in European qualifiers to 43 games despite Dervisoglu’s late consolation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/eddie-nketiah-record-scorer-england-under-21-turkey-euro-2021"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rick Parry’s proposals overwhelmingly backed by EFL clubs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;£250m instant payment to aid Covid crisis key to deal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFL clubs have swung as a bloc behind Project Big Picture, despite concerns over a potential seismic power shift at the top of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Championship clubs overwhelmingly agreeing to support the chair Rick Parry’s proposals and League One and Two doing likewise after a day of emergency meetings, club owners and executives have calculated that reform of the game – and a Covid-19 bailout – is worth the cost of an agglomeration of power among the Premier League’s biggest clubs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/efl-clubs-agree-to-put-their-support-behind-project-big-picture"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The €45m signing’s tenacity earned him a cephalopodic nickname in Spain and he hopes he can live up to expectations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eight-legged tattoo on Thomas Partey’s arm recalls a time when his gifts drew an unusual comparison. “I always say, if I would be an animal, I would be an octopus,” he says. “I remember when I was in Almería they called me ‘the octopus’ because I stole a lot of balls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/06/thomas-partey-made-at-atletico-and-now-ready-to-break-free-at-arsenal"&gt;Thomas Partey: made at Atlético and now ready to break free at Arsenal | Nick Ames&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/if-i-was-an-animal-id-be-an-octopus-partey-plans-a-splash-at-arsenal"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>England's class of 2018 return favour as Southgate looks back to go forward | David Hytner</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kyle Walker’s 50th cap came in Sunday’s win against Belgium alongside Eric Dier and room was found for Kieran Trippier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle Walker now has more England caps than Sir Geoff Hurst. “Which is incredible,” Gareth Southgate said, and the England manager meant that sincerely, his admiration for Walker’s achievement plain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manchester City defender won his 50th cap in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/11/england-belgium-nations-league-match-report"&gt;2-1 Nations League win against Belgium&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday and it took him level on the all-time list with Phil Neal. “Obviously, I was the only one in the dressing room who knew,” Southgate said, with a smile. Neal, the richly decorated Liverpool full-back, won the last of his caps in 1983.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/12/england-class-of-2018-return-favour-gareth-southgate-looks-back-to-go-forward-belgium"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How Project Big Picture changed the politics of football in one swoop | David Conn</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/how-project-big-picture-changed-the-politics-of-football-in-one-swoop</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liverpool’s and Manchester United’s plan has been roundly condemned by the Premier League, but leaves the English game in uncharted territory &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Premier League’s 20 clubs will assemble for a scheduled meeting this week with an agenda spectacularly disrupted by the Project Big Picture proposals of Liverpool and Manchester United to reshape the league itself and the English football pyramid. The other four clubs in the so-called big six are said to have been initially infuriated when the plan, for overwhelming voting control in their hands allied to a much fairer sharing of money with the EFL, was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/11/project-big-picture-premier-league-and-efl-plan-radical-reform-to-avoid-crisis" title=""&gt;leaked on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, and some time was spent assuring them Liverpool and United were not the source of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liverpool’s majority owner John W Henry, the main driving force behind proposals he has worked on since 2017, is said to have been undeterred by the largely hostile reaction in the media and of the government, and to be preparing to press the case further. The EFL chairman, Rick Parry, has stressed his 72 clubs’ support and gratitude for the plan, which after months of delay by the Premier League centrally, offers to pay the EFL a £250m crisis fund immediately, and a transformational future 25% of net Premier League TV deals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/how-project-big-picture-changed-the-politics-of-football-in-one-swoop"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/12/project-big-picture-reaction-to-plans-premier-league-efl</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The proposals have provoked outrage at many Premier League sides, but struggling EFL clubs are taking a pragmatic approach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day after the story broke Liverpool appeared to accept the plan they have co-conceived will need some refinement. They are understood to be prepared for a robust debate on the proposals, bracing themselves in particular for a battle around the plan for nine clubs to receive preferential voting rights. There is an expectation at Anfield that the leaked blueprint for football’s future will not be the final version; whether that is enough to dampen the anger of other clubs in the division, and beyond, and get everyone amicably around the table remains to be seen. Manchester United are understood by sources closely involved in the proposal to have a similar outlook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/12/project-big-picture-reaction-to-plans-premier-league-efl"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Gerrard reveals he asked Pepijn Lijnders, the first-team development coach, to always include Alexander-Arnold in his group when taking his ’B’ Licence course, and handed him the captain’s armband during a comeback game in Liverpool’s Under-18s side last season. “It was my way of telling Trent that I believed he could make it for Liverpool one day,” Gerrard writes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/06/from-degaard-to-mastour-what-happened-to-next-generation-2015"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Marcus Rashford given MBE for school meals campaign – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/oct/10/marcus-rashford-given-mbe-for-school-meals-campaign-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford has been officially recognised for his efforts to secure free meals for vulnerable children during the coronavirus pandemic. R&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/09/marcus-rashford-given-mbe-in-birthday-honours-for-school-meals-campaign"&gt;ashford has been made an MBE in the 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours list&lt;/a&gt;. The 22 year-old footballer launched a high-profile campaign which resulted in the government changing policy over the issue of free school meals vouchers during lockdown, helping to ensure that children in need did not go hungry over the summer break. England manager Gareth Southgate said Rashford received a round of applause from England's players and staff after being awarded an MBE medal in the Queen's Birthday Honours list. 'For somebody of his age to be able to make the difference he has is a phenomenal achievement,' Southgate said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/oct/10/marcus-rashford-given-mbe-for-school-meals-campaign-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Rafael dressing up as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle to Ricardo Quaresma riding around a castle on a horse, the 2020 summer transfer window hasn't failed to bring us some great announcement videos, including a great piece of acting from Tottenham's Matt Doherty as he deleted his 'I love Arsenal forever and ever and ever' tweet from 2012&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/oct/05/the-most-memorable-transfer-announcements-of-the-2020-summer-window-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'My worst day': Solskjær and Mourinho on Tottenham's 6-1 thrashing of Manchester United – video</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tottenham Hotspur inflicted a miserable afternoon for Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Manchester United with a 6-1 thrashing at Old Trafford. This was the first time since November 1957 they've conceded four in the first half, equalling their record heaviest defeat to Manchester City in 2011. Despite opening the score through a penalty from Bruno Fernandes it was six without reply from there on. Anthony Martial's red card was the catalyst on an afternoon that got worse and worse for United&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/04/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Harry Kane stars in Tottenham's 6-1 thrashing of hapless Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/oct/04/my-worst-day-solskjr-and-mourinho-on-tottenhams-6-1-thrashing-of-manchester-united-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/oct/01/san-diego-loyal-players-walk-off-field-after-alleged-homophobic-abuse-video-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;San Diego Loyal players walked off the pitch at the start of the second half of their game against Phoenix Rising after homophobic abuse was allegedly directed at one of their players. Loyal star Collin Martin came out publicly in June 2018. Loyal were 3-1 up before the game was forfeited. Phoenix player Junior Flemmings has said that the accusations are 'false'&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/oct/01/san-diego-loyal-players-walk-off-field-after-alleged-homophobic-abuse-video-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Quick backheel reactions result in last-minute Hartford Athletic winner – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/oct/01/quick-backheel-reactions-result-in-last-minute-hartford-athletic-winner-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With their USL game fast approaching added time, it looked as though Hartford Athletic had thrown away a 2-0 lead to Philadelphia Union II. However, after the Union goalkeeper had collected the ball from a cross, he attempted to release the ball down the field, only for Hartford's Danny Barrera to stick his leg out backwards to intercept. The result was a perfect looping backheel into the empty net, an inventive way to win all three points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/amazing-world-of-sport"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Watch more from the amazing world of sport series here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/oct/01/quick-backheel-reactions-result-in-last-minute-hartford-athletic-winner-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Barcelona's transfer blunders bite back on dreadful deadline day | Sid Lowe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/07/barcelonas-transfer-blunders-bite-back-on-dreadful-deadline-day</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Barça were left scrabbling for a deal to balance broken books after years of waste on bad signings and mindbending wages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the transfer window closed, Barcelona had seen &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/sep/28/hurricane-luis-suarez-unleashed-in-spectacular-atletico-madrid-arrival-la-liga-sid-lowe"&gt;Luis Suárez go to Atlético Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/02/ivan-rakitic-move-brings-revelry-at-sevilla-and-relief-in-barcelona"&gt;Ivan Rakitic to Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;, Arturo Vidal to Internazionale, Rafinha to Paris Saint-Germain and Jean-Clair Todibo to Benfica in return for a grand total of €3.5m – and that is the players they managed to get rid of. A couple of hours earlier, the club had been trying to force Ousmane Dembélé to go to Manchester United. He had cost €105m plus a further €45m in variables three years ago; now they hoped to raise €0, but did not manage that either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left without the money to make them happen, nor did they succeed in signing Memphis Depay and Eric García. The lights were still on at the Camp Nou offices well after midnight on the frantic final day of transfer business, but it wasn’t because they were closing the deals their coach, Ronald Koeman, requested, his revolution gathering pace. Instead it painted another portrait of their crisis, Barcelona were stuck, another failure consummated. Koeman admitted this was not the squad he planned for but it is the one he will have to work with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/07/barcelonas-transfer-blunders-bite-back-on-dreadful-deadline-day"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Julen Lopetegui's redemption seems complete as he builds a new Sevilla | Sid Lowe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/julen-lopeteguis-redemption-seems-complete-as-he-builds-a-new-sevilla</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The trauma of the manager’s sacking by Spain and a bitterly brief stay at Real Madrid is all but forgotten with his latest club&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a moment late on Sunday night when the camera closed in on Luuk de Jong which seemed to say something about trust and team, and what they’re building together at Sevilla. He had scored at the Camp Nou – as he had done against Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Real Betis, Inter and Manchester United – but having opened the scoring inside eight minutes the ball had been back in play just 41 seconds when Philippe Coutinho equalised. Now, withdrawn six minutes from the end of an exhausting evening, the former Newcastle striker sat in the stands gesturing for his teammates to remain calm in the final moments of a 1-1 draw against Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/juventus-napoli-covid-no-show-serie-a-covid-court"&gt;Juve pretend it is business as usual to put heat on Napoli's Covid no-show | Nicky Bandini&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/julen-lopeteguis-redemption-seems-complete-as-he-builds-a-new-sevilla"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Juve pretend it is business as usual to put heat on Napoli's Covid no-show | Nicky Bandini</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/juventus-napoli-covid-no-show-serie-a-covid-court</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The result of the biggest match of the season so far may be decided in court after Napoli stayed away because of Covid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stage was set for one of the biggest games on the Serie A calendar – Juventus against Napoli, historic rivals from opposite ends of Italy’s boot. The wealthiest team in the country, fresh from their &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/26/juventus-claim-ninth-title-in-a-row-as-ronaldo-sets-up-win-over-sampdoria"&gt;ninth consecutive title&lt;/a&gt;, against opponents who have consistently outperformed their budget to produce some of the most entertaining and effective football on the peninsula, finishing as runners-up in three of the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sub-plots were enticing. Could Andrea Pirlo, in his third game as a manager, answer the questions posed by his former teammate Gennaro Gattuso? Who would shine brighter between an ageing Cristiano Ronaldo and Napoli’s club-record signing Victor Osimhen?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/juventus-napoli-covid-no-show-serie-a-covid-court"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Gladbach fly flag at Köln after special win in derby that retains sense of self | Andy Brassell</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/borussia-monchengladbach-fly-flag-koln-derby-bundesliga</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was confusion over fan attendance but what was clear was that this match still has an edge in strange times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has become one of the Bundesliga’s iconic sights. When Borussia Mönchengladbach win, Marcus Thuram picks one of his teammates’ shirts and, wearing a beaming grin, sits it atop one of the corner flags before removing the pole from the turf and flying the makeshift flag in front of the Kurve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this special win, Gladbach’s first of the season and in the derby at Köln to boot, Thuram selected the shirt of Stefan Lainer, the team’s right-back and the scorer of the second goal. Performing the ritual wasn’t easy – as RP’s Jannik Sorgatz pointed out, “Lainer’s jersey was too wet and heavy” after hours of torrential rain but it didn’t dampen the visitors’ mood, and Thuram was not too deterred, as he hadn’t been through a typically industrious afternoon. Neither was the Frenchman put off by the heckles of 300 home fans, whose insults were clearer than normal in a near-empty RheinEnergie Stadion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/borussia-monchengladbach-fly-flag-koln-derby-bundesliga"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Thomas Tuchel takes aim at PSG over lack of spending in transfer window</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/thomas-tuchel-takes-aim-at-psg-over-lack-of-spending-in-transfer-window</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tuchel wants reinforcements all over the pitch but sporting director Leonardo says he should be creative with what he has &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_adam_white_?lang=en"&gt;Adam White&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_"&gt;Eric Devin&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/"&gt;Get French Football News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-field implosions are nothing new for PSG. However, this week they have taken their self-destructive repertoire off the field, with Thomas Tuchel’s increasingly combative relationship with sporting director Leonardo escalating into a public spat. After the manager publicly criticised the club’s haphazard and often glacial business in the transfer market, Leonardo hit back. “We did not like these statements,” said the sporting director after PSG’s 6-1 mauling of Angers on Friday. “The club did not like them and neither did I. If he decides to stay, he needs to respect the board’s strategy.” With his position weakening and circumstances conspiring against him, Tuchel appears to be edging nearer to the exit, with Massimiliano Allegri thought to be Leonardo’s target to replace him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuchel’s relationship with Leonardo had started cordially. With Leonardo acting as bad cop, the pair subtly handled the Neymar-to-Barcelona saga in the summer of 2019. Honest and forthright, Leonardo was able to manipulate the narrative in the media, allowing Tuchel and his squad to stay close to the player, maintaining the line that proceedings were out of his hands and that he really wanted Neymar to stay. The relationship has subsequently soured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/thomas-tuchel-takes-aim-at-psg-over-lack-of-spending-in-transfer-window"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alex Wilkinson lauds “amicable” Sydney FC discussions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sky Blues back in training ahead of A-League three-peat bid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the A-League clubs and Professional Footballers Australia close in on a new collective bargaining agreement, reigning champions Sydney FC have reached a pay deal with their players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations have continued since the players’ union members rejected a proposal by clubs in September but they are expected to sign off next season’s CBA in the coming days. The clubs have instead been negotiating pay deals directly, and on Tuesday Sydney confirmed they had reached an agreement with their playing group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/07/sydney-fc-agree-on-pay-deal-with-players-as-a-league-closes-in-on-cba"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Is the USMNT in danger of developing into a world-class outfit?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/01/is-the-usmnt-in-danger-of-developing-into-a-world-class-outfit</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US were humiliated after failing to reach the World Cup. But players of real talent are now at Europe’s biggest clubs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most encouraging sign for the current iteration of the US men’s national team is that its best, and as a result, most high-profile stars are all aged 22 or under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading light in this group, Christian Pulisic, is a player who is well on the way to becoming one of the most entertaining attacking players in the world, and more encouragement comes from the fact some of his international teammates look more likely to join him at that level than get left behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/01/is-the-usmnt-in-danger-of-developing-into-a-world-class-outfit"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Vinícius Júnior wrestles Real Madrid to victory while Atalanta crush Lazio</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brazilian wins ball back to score winner against Valladolid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atlético draw blank; Lukaku hits two in Inter’s 5-2 rout&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/strong&gt; forward Vinícius Júnior came off the bench to fire his side to a scrappy 1-0 home victory against &lt;strong&gt;Real Valladolid&lt;/strong&gt; in La Liga as the champions found a way to win despite failing to sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian, who replaced the ineffective Luka Jovic, fought to win the ball back on the edge of the area and after it bounced into his path off a Valladolid defender he kept his composure to break the deadlock in the 65th minute. Zinedine Zidane’s side, who lost Eden Hazard to injury on the day of the game and were also without Toni Kroos, again lacked fluidity in attack in their third match of the season but just about deserved the win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/30/european-roundup-lukaku-internazionale-atletico-real-madrid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Arsène Wenger: ‘I try to read  everything that helps me understand human beings’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/11/arsene-wenger-arsenal-manager-football</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The erudite Frenchman who transformed English football takes questions from politicians, artists, readers – and José Mourinho. Introduction by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timlewis"&gt;Tim Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsène Wenger often imagines what he will say to God when he dies. In most of these exchanges, God asks Wenger to justify his time on Earth, how he gave meaning to his own life and to others. “I tried to win football matches!” Wenger will explain. God looks at him, sceptical: “That’s all?” Wenger goes on: winning matches is really hard to do. If you do your job well, you bring joy to millions, a collective euphoria and catharsis. And if you don’t… At this point Wenger snaps back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes I feel I’m scared for having only done football in my life,” says Wenger, who is 70, on a video call from Zurich. “So, when I speak to God, it’s a bit pretentious. It’s just that if God exists and they have a test to see if you go to hell or to heaven, it might look ridiculous to only have dedicated your life to winning football games. And that’s why I came up with that idea. I feel sometimes it could feel meaningless that you dedicated your whole life to that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/11/arsene-wenger-arsenal-manager-football"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Premier League may not need the pyramid but England and Southgate surely do | Jonathan Liew</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/10/premier-league-may-not-need-the-pyramid-but-england-and-southgate-surely-do</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Put simply: this is an England team that would simply not exist without the Football League&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foul was won just inside the Wales half by Danny Ings. Released by Southampton as a teenager for being too small, Ings came through the Bournemouth academy, making his professional debut when they were still in League Two. Ings took the free-kick quickly to Kalvin Phillips, who until this season had played all his football in the Championship with Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillips found Atlético Madrid’s Kieran Trippier on the right. At 30, Trippier has still played more than half his league football in the EFL, with Barnsley and Burnley. Trippier slipped the ball to Jack Grealish, who credits his three seasons with Aston Villa in the Championship for hardening him mentally and physically. Grealish’s cross found the head of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, a product of the Sheffield United academy, via a loan spell at Northampton.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/10/premier-league-may-not-need-the-pyramid-but-england-and-southgate-surely-do"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mars beware, my World XI may lack Messi but De Bruyne makes it tick | Jonathan Wilson</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/10/mars-beware-my-world-xi-may-lack-messi-but-de-bruyne-makes-it-tick</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking a lineup is useful, less for who makes the cut than for what the process says about the current state of the game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fifa world rankings rarely fail to raise an eyebrow. Óscar Washington Tabárez is one of the world’s great coaches but are Uruguay, who scraped a 2-1 win over Chile on Thursday, really the sixth-best side in the world right now? Nobody who saw England’s notional first-choice centre-back pairing of Harry Maguire and Joe Gomez in separate action for their clubs last Sunday would feel comfortable with their ranking of fourth. Germany 14th: when do we start talking seriously about Jogi Löw? And Belgium, whom England face on Sunday, top? Even after 12 straight wins before Thursday’s draw with Ivory Coast, even as their Golden Generation lingers at the summit, how many of their side would get in an Earth XI to take on Mars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a danger in posing such questions of sounding like Michael Owen, boldly insisting that no Croat would get into the England side after Steve McClaren’s team &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/04/sport.comment#comment-2092058" title=""&gt;had failed to qualify for Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt;, twice losing to Croatia. But the exercise of picking a World XI is useful, less for the names included in the final lineup than for what the process says about the state of the game (or at least it does if you do it properly, rather than acting like Florentino Pérez in his &lt;em&gt;gálacticos&lt;/em&gt; pomp and just ramming together loads of famous players).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/10/mars-beware-my-world-xi-may-lack-messi-but-de-bruyne-makes-it-tick"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Sign up now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has visited Giza will attest, English football is not the only pyramid in the world that attracts no end of unsavoury hucksters eager to capitalise on its popularity for a quick and often unscrupulously attained buck. Obviously, the famously altruistic and benevolent American charitable trusts Fenway Sports Group and the Glazer Family are not among them, as their unofficial mouthpiece Rick Parry has been eager to point out this week. Chatting to anyone who would listen on Monday, Rick insisted Project Big Picture is the gift that will keep on giving to endangered clubs outside the Premier League elite. Meanwhile, the general consensus seems to be that it looks suspiciously &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/12/project-big-picture-under-pressure-as-premier-league-clubs-fail-to-back-reform"&gt;like one that will keep on taking&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/13/the-fiver-yes-more-on-project-big-old-picture"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Plus: the shortest Premier League career and playing for three relegated teams in one season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com"&gt;Mail &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com"&gt;us&lt;/a&gt; your questions or tweet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu"&gt;@TheKnowledge_GU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It used to be the standard retirement plan for a player to run a pub after leaving the game. Who was the last top-flight player in England known to have done this?” &lt;/strong&gt;wonders Ian Robson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, given the modern-day footballer can’t really go near a pub without causing a “Twitter storm” and generally make a packet of cash, choosing a post-football career ordering in ale and crisps is not as tempting as it used to be. Isn’t that right, Bobby?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/07/who-is-the-most-recent-premier-league-footballer-to-own-or-run-a-pub-knowledge"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Women’s Super League: talking points from the weekend’s action</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everton look unstoppable but face competition from the two Manchester clubs – meanwhile, West Ham need to be tougher &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everton keep on soaring&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I don’t know what Everton are feeding their players at their Finch Farm training base, but it is working. Like the men’s team, the women have a 100% record and are flying, with Aston Villa the latest to feel the impact in a 6-0 home defeat. The new signings are coming good: Valerie Gauvin, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/06/a-real-coup-everton-women-sign-france-forward-valerie-gauvin"&gt;who joined from Montpellier in the summer&lt;/a&gt;, came off the bench to score; Hayley Raso joined in January and has become an important part of the team. When I saw them beat Birmingham last week Nicoline Sørensen, another summer arrival, was also brilliant. They are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/30/gauvin-seals-everton-win-over-birmingham-in-womens-fa-cup-semi-final"&gt;in the FA Cup final&lt;/a&gt;, and it is a pleasure to see my old club back vying for trophies. Willie Kirk, the coach, and his club share a vision, which is to turn the club into one capable of winning the Champions League, and we’re seeing the real impact of their vision now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City start to purr after scratchy start&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Manchester City started the season unconvincingly, losing the Community Shield against Chelsea, edging Aston Villa and drawing at home against Brighton. But I’ve seen them play twice in the last week and they have certainly moved on. Last Thursday they &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/01/manchester-city-arsenal-womens-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report"&gt;knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the way they rolled over their opponents showed me they had found their groove, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/oct/04/manchester-city-v-tottenham-womens-super-league-live"&gt;performance against Tottenham&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday confirmation of that. There were so many changes in the close season – a manager moving on after six years with a very settled squad, bringing and bedding in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/18/manchester-city-women-sign-usa-world-cup-winner-rose-lavelle"&gt;Rose Levelle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/10/manchester-city-women-sign-usa-world-cup-winner-sam-mewis"&gt;Sam Mewis&lt;/a&gt;, and then getting Alex Greenwood and Lucy Bronze; it was always going to take them some time to settle. This is a different team to the one I watched in the Community Shield. For Spurs the signs were more worrying: they have conceded four in each of their last two games, first against Arsenal in the FA Cup when it was goalless in the 73ed minute, then against City when it was 1-0 after 50 minutes and 4-0 after 70. Top teams keep the pedal down; Spurs seem to switch off, and they need to stop these capitulations from becoming a habit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/sep/28/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another handball horror show, Calvert-Lewin is benefiting from Ancelotti effect and sentiment alone will not save Lampard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ole Gunnar Solskjær said Manchester United had “three or four weeks to catch up to a few teams”, and how it showed. United could not get out to prevent crosses or track Brighton’s runners. Their lack of match sharpness is a consequence of their lack of a pre-season. It was interesting to hear Gareth Southgate say the players in his England squad in early September who had played in European competition until mid‑August were the fittest because they had, effectively, played all the way through. Solskjær has a different view and feels comfortable in advancing it as mitigation, essentially because it is not his fault, rather that of these unprecedented times. But the message is United cannot do the basics because their bodies will not let them. &lt;strong&gt;David Hytner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/sep/28/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Golden Goal: Lakhdar Belloumi for Algeria v West Germany (1982) | Simon Burnton</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/22/golden-goal-lakhdar-belloumi-for-algeria-v-west-germany-1982</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Belloumi, a great denied a move to Europe by age and violence, stunned an overconfident West Germany at the World Cup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year the Premier League posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_l35EMxGRI"&gt;a video compilation of the fastest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_l35EMxGRI"&gt;goals from kick-off&lt;/a&gt;. They were all scored within seconds of the game starting, ignoring the mid-match instant post-kick-off goal, but give a taste of the genre as a whole, populated as it almost entirely is by defensive blunders and hopeful hoofs, goals that almost all rely on a convenient ricochet or two at some point in the buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1982, against West Germany, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek_IfWbtG_U"&gt;Algeria scored a goal&lt;/a&gt; similar in its speed following a restart, but here there are no hoofs or ricochets, just 23 seconds of teamwork and precision. They produced this in the most exacting circumstances: immediately after conceding an equaliser against massively favoured European giants, in their country’s first World Cup finals fixture. “We were,” the goalscorer, Lakhdar Belloumi, later said, “the Brazilians of Africa.” And for at least half a minute in Gijón, the world saw it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/22/golden-goal-lakhdar-belloumi-for-algeria-v-west-germany-1982"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Buy a classic sport photograph – Cantona bosses Liverpool</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/12/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-cantona-bosses-liverpool</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest in a Guardian Print Shop &lt;a href="https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/the-big-sport-picture"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; featuring classic sports images. This week’s picture captures the joy of Leeds United beating Liverpool in a seven-goal Charity Shield thriller, on the eve of the first ever Premier League season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Leeds United and Liverpool met in the Charity Shield in the curtain raiser for the inaugural Premier League season in 1992, Leeds were the reigning First Division champions and Liverpool, winners two years prior, were the FA Cup holders. Leeds arrived at Wembley boasting a formidable squad including the likes of Gary McAllister, John Lukic, Gordon Strachan, Gary Speed, Lee Chapman and Eric Cantona. The enigmatic Frenchman (pictured here) would guide Leeds to a 4-3 victory with a hat-trick, and weeks later would become the first player to score three in a single Premier League match. However, Leeds would ultimately lose Cantona to Manchester United in November that season – an irreconcilable loss – and limp to a 17th-place finish, only narrowly avoiding the drop; meanwhile, Liverpool would finish sixth and endure a further 27 years of domestic heartbreak before landing the big one last term. Now, these two rejuvenated titans will face one another in the league for the first time in 16 years, as the 2020/21 Premier League season gets underway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/12/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-cantona-bosses-liverpool"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The former Arsenal and Denmark striker on how he lost his way as a professional footballer and a person, why he does not blame Arsène Wenger and his own hopes for a management career&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 3am one morning in the summer of 2011, when he was still only 23 and his promising career at Arsenal had begun to slip away, Nicklas Bendtner arrived at his favourite casino in London. “I’m way too drunk to sit at a table,” Bendtner remembers. “That much I get. But roulette is a different matter. Red, black, red, black. How hard can it be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After 90 minutes I’ve lost £400,000. Money I don’t have. My bank account is overdrawn and I’m bankrupt if my luck doesn’t turn. I stagger into the loos and splash water on my face. Then I find a cashier and get another £50,000 of chips.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/09/nicklas-bendtner-i-became-too-fond-of-the-lifestyle-that-came-with-the-money"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>When fair becomes foul in the make-believe world of Ifab's chief David Elleray</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/09/fair-can-become-foul-in-the-tin-whistle-world-of-david-elleray-referee-ifab</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ruling body has a major hand in tinkering with the rules every season but the results are often to the detriment of the spectacle and sometimes the safety of its match officials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of a cavernous room sits an enormous armchair. Beyond it hundreds of giant screens – each of them rolling footage back and forth in super slo-mo of professional footballers’ arms. Arms everywhere, all in dangerous proximity to the ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At regular intervals a stern, clipped Home Counties voice can be heard uttering the same two words over and over again. “Unnaturally bigger, unnaturally bigger, unnaturally bigger.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/09/fair-can-become-foul-in-the-tin-whistle-world-of-david-elleray-referee-ifab"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Less money but lots of ideas: how the pandemic transfer window unfolded | Fabrizio Romano</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/11/less-money-but-lots-of-ideas-how-the-pandemic-transfer-window-unfolded</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A unique window saw Chelsea spend heavily, Liverpool make the signing of the summer and the Carlo Ancelotti factor work well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the end of April and Juventus’s sporting director, Fabio Paratici, was talking about the upcoming transfer window for the first time: “We will have to be creative, imaginative.” He was absolutely right. More ideas, less money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five months have passed since then and we have just been through an extremely long and intense transfer window. It was unique because the circumstances had changed. There were some great ideas, although not all of them came through. It was a stop-start window, at times coming to a complete standstill, at others exhilarating. Above all, it was a window in line with the summer of a pandemic – it changed the world and therefore the transfer market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/11/less-money-but-lots-of-ideas-how-the-pandemic-transfer-window-unfolded"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Manchester United lack leadership and transfer PR fixes won't change that</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/manchester-united-lack-leadership-transfer-pr-fixes-solskjaer-pat-head-tottenham-6-1-decline</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tottenham’s 6-1 win caps a miserable decline and Solskjær’s pat on the head from Mourinho reflects manager’s lack of authority&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the final whistle blew at Villa Park on Sunday evening, the temptation was to laugh and shrug and write off the previous nine hours as just one of those days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freakishness can breed freakishness as though the forces of chaos, once out of the cage, can be very hard to recapture. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/04/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Manchester United had been hammered at home&lt;/a&gt;! By Tottenham! &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/04/aston-villa-liverpool-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Liverpool had been battered away&lt;/a&gt;! West Ham had won &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/04/leicester-west-ham-premier-league-match-report"&gt;a second game in a row&lt;/a&gt;! The temptation perhaps was to repeat the lie that in the Premier League anybody can beat anybody on their day. Or, more realistically, consideration was perhaps given to the extent to which the breakdown of order this autumn has been caused by fatigue, a lack of preparation time and the absence of fans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/manchester-united-lack-leadership-transfer-pr-fixes-solskjaer-pat-head-tottenham-6-1-decline"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
